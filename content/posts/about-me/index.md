You guessed it, my name is Colin and Iâ€™m the author of this site. What more do you want to know? Throughout my life I've been known as someone who asks a lot of questions. As I've asked questions I've learned that not all questions have complete answers. For those questions without firm answers, I rely on my education, intuition, and simplifying assumptions to draw what I consider to be meaningful conclusions.

I have a degree in Chemical Engineering from Brigham Young University. My training as a chemical engineer rekindled a childish sense of fascination for the world around me. I love finding new ways to use math, science, and computers to reason and attempt to explain observations in my life. I hope that you feel a similar sense of excitement and interest as you read my posts.

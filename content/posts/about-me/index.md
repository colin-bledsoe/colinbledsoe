You guessed it, my name is Colin and Iâ€™m the author of this site. What more do you want to know? Throughout my life I've been known as someone who asks a lot of questions. As I've asked questions I've learned that not all questions have complete answers. For those questions without firm answers, I rely on my education, intuition, and simplifying assumptions to draw what I consider to be meaningful conclusions.

I have a degree in Chemical Engineering from Brigham Young University. My training as a chemical engineer rekindled a childish sense of fascination for the world around me. I love finding new ways to use math, science, and computers to reason and attempt to explain observations in my life. I hope that you feel a similar sense of excitement and intrigue as you read my posts.

*A little more about me..*

**Engineer**

I have spent 7 years as a process engineer / data scientist in a manufacturing setting. During this time, I've worked in the semiconductor, carbon fiber composite, and pharmaceutical industries. As a process engineer, I frequently feel like a detective seeking out clues that ultimately lead to a discovery about an event either positvely or negatively impacting production. Every day I review data from a variety of sources, collaborate with operator and maintenance personnel, and physically troubleshoot equipment to come up with creative and efficient ways to reduce waste while creating a high quality products.

**Father**

I have a brilliant, beautiful, and patient wife and together we're raising 2 sweet and silly daughters. Experiencing the ups and downs of life together as a companionship is simultaneously a great joy and a challenging opportunity for reflection and personal growth (kids, am I right).

**Thinker**

I have a seemingly infinite capacity to ask questions. To me, this trait is distinct from my previous description as an engineer. I consider myself highly imaginative. Deep down inside, I literally believe that provided adequate resources any individual can conquer any problem. Most of my questions follow a common theme, how do things work and why are things the way they are? I entertain myself as I try to answer them.

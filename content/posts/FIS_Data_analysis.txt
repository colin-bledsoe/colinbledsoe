FIS super G racing data analysis
Top speepd by player weight and height/ski length
Which segment of each race has higher variation, how does the segment compare, steep elevation change?

How do race times compare pre-post a crash on the slope?

Looks like 1st place for the interval can have a negative split
Second place is always red and so is everyone else. Why doesn't this change?
First place ranking splits are distance from second place everyone else is relative to first place time
Racing is interesting because the absolute time doesn't tell everything about how the race goes
Also the absolute time at each interval is not a fair judgment either b/c doesn't say how much racer's are making up time
Need to use the split time.
Looks like split time ranking is actually based on absolute time not the time of the interval
In both men's and women's the first place winnder gets first place absolute ranking in the final leg because they get to that split interval before everyone else
Would  be cool to see relative times to see which skier is most improved during the race, crummy start but could have caught up.



Super G Speed Science
While working out the details of the multi-component phase equilibria problem from
my Bread and Brown Sugar blog post, I decided to turn on some light-entertainment.
I wanted to watch something entertaining but not too distracting and thought the 
the FIS Men's Super G race seemed like a perfect fit. Turns out I was wrong,
when the alternative is sifting through college thermodynamics lecture notes, 
watching skiers fly down a slope that they haven't practiced on (first run is all they get)
at speeds greater than 70 mph is very distracting.

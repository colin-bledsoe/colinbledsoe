I love process control and automation. Recently I created a feature for a private escape room birthday party. I called my creation the diversion box. The box itself is pretty inconspicuous. Though boxes tend to contain or conceal objects, this box was never meant to be opened. Instead, when presented with the correct key, the box ejects a subtle clue that unlocks further progress in the escape room.

I designed the mechanism on the interior of the box to run using an Arduino Nano, a small SG90 servo motor, a linear hall effect sensor, a power supply, and a 3D printed scotch yoke that I modeled in Autodesk Fusion360.

During operation, the Arduino Nano microcontroller loops over a sequence of commands while it listens for a digital input signal that is generated by the hall effect sensor after it encounters a correctly polarized (meaning the orientation of the magnet is significant) magnetic field. After the input signal is received, the Arduino compares its current state, either clue presented or clue hidden, against the proposed state, clue presented. If the device is not in the clue presented state, a digital output signal is sent to the servo motor to rotate into the position corresponding to the clue presented state. The clever scotch yoke mechanism converts the rotational motion of the servo motor into a linear sliding motion and the clue is pushed out of the box. If the arduino were already in the clue presented state, no transition is necessary. When the magnetic field is no longer present, the hall effect sensor's digital signal switches from high to low. In response to this signal change, the Arduino recognizes a state transition and commands the motor to retract the clue.

I modeled the hardware layout in Fusion360 and then mounted the components on a sheet of cardboard that I could lower into the box to keep things organized. Though not visible in these pictures or videos, after completing the box I screwed the lid into place to prevent it from being opened during the party. This was a fun little project, I hope you enjoyed reading about it!

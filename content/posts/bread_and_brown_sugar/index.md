Earlier this week we noticed that our brown sugar had hardened making it difficult to use. Fortunately, we know that dried out brown sugar can be rejuvenated by reintroducing moisture to the container. I'd heard that brown sugar can be rehydrated by placing a slice of fresh bread into the container with the dried out brown sugar. I thought it would be interesting to weigh a slice of bread before adding it to the bag of brown sugar and then again after the sugar had softened to see if I could measure how much water was being exchanged between the bread and dried out brown sugar.

| Initial Bread Weight  | Final Bread Weight | % Change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 28.5 grams   | 24.5 grams  | -14% |

After about a day, the moisture from the bread had been transferred to the brown sugar leaving behind a dry piece of bread and some fresh and cakey brown sugar. The bread was tangibly dry and crisp like a a piece of toast. My kitchen scale showed that the bread lost 4 grams of water weight.

*There it is, I measured something! If you're satisfied, I'm glad you read this far and I hope that you learned something new. If you have more time, keep reading! This measurement resulted in a cascade of additonal questions.*

Brown sugar is more hygroscopic than the average food, it spontaneously absorbs moisture from the environment/air around it. Understanding this fact, **why did the brown sugar dry out to begin with?**

Why would a substance that leeches water from the air around it dry out? Surely such a simple question must have a simple answer. Boy, was I wrong. I'm committed to this blog post, because it adequately represents the statement in my "About Me" post.."As I've asked questions I've learned that not all questions have complete answers. For those questions without firm answers, I rely on my education, intuition, and simplifying assumptions to draw what I consider to be meaningful conclusions." I'll walk you through the meaningful conclusion that I settled on and how I explored this question.

Brown sugar is sort of like a composite material, it is composed of small solid crystals of white sugar that are enveloped in a thin layer of viscous, liquid molasses. The thin layer of molasses allows the coarse crystals to glide past one another and clump together. Both white sugar and molasses are natively hygroscopic but by some unknown means to many people on the internet, hygroscopic molasses can dry out gradually increasing it's viscosity until the sugar crystals eventually stick together in a hard mass. Maybe i'm not being clear about why i'm confused. Sure all things dry out, if the air around an object has less moisture than the object itself, a concentration gradient forms and entropy drives water from the region of high concentrations of moisture in the object towards regions of low concentrations of moisture in the air. Ya that makes sense, but hygroscopic materials suck moisture from the air, they can reverse entropy by concentrating moisture in a single location. A quick Google search shows that there is not very much freely available scientific literature about brown sugar's hygroscopic nature. There is a plethora of material about creative ways to rehydrate brown sugar, storage practices, and substituting brown sugar in recipes that call for white sugar. To make matters worse, none of my college textbooks (Thermodynamics, Separations, or Heat and Mass Transfer) mention hygroscopicity in their indices. Because of this lack of available information I pivoted and adjusted my search vocabulary to focus on a material and characteristic that is supported by a much larger body of scientific literature, dessiccant silica gel. Pressure swing adsorption using activated carbon.
<!-- A quick internet search will tell you that sugar has a high water activity level, it is a hygroscopic compound. Understanding that sugar and brown sugar want to leach all of the moisture from the bodies around it, why does brown sugar dry out? I think this has something to do with vapor pressure, so if the activity of water in the substance is less than 1 then it will dry out slower than water, the substance wants to hold onto water more than water holds onto itself. Water activity (vapor pressure of water in the material) increases with temperature, the higher the temperature the more energy the water has to leave the substance. Use the temperature to determine the equilibrium humidity of the air, then use the actual humidity to see how much water can be absorbed by that air. Then use the water activity to say how much will leave the system? How is water activity related to hygroscopicity? If water activity >0.85 means you can't support bacteria life then does that also mean the food isn't hygroscopic otherwise it would absorb water and then have a water activity capable of supporting bacterial life? Take a slice of bread, weigh it, allow it to dry out over night, weigh it again. That is how much water was lost. Then the next day, fill a cup of water with the same mass of the moisture lost, and pull out another slice of bread. See which reaches equilibrium first, pure water or bread. I would expect the water to evaporate before the bread because the bread has a water activity less than 1. Where did the water go? Why does heating brown sugar have the same effect as reintroducing moisture? Oxymoron that it is hygroscopic but that it dried out...how does hygroscopic activity present itself, so at some moisture levels the sugar sucks water from the atmosphere but if its dry enough the air sucks water back out? Ziploc bag method has less headspace above the sugar to be exchanged each time the container is opened to the atmosphere. Heating it is only for immediate use because you are actually driving more moisture out
- Though we may not see it, the materials around us are dynamic systems. They move towards equilibrium. 
- The water in my closed system (sealed ziploc bag) of brown sugar and air reaches equilibrium. The equilibrium conditions are dependent on the amount of brown sugar and air in the closed system. 
- Everytime the bag is opened, the boundaries on the closed system are broken and the system opens up to mass transfer. The solid brown sugar remains in the bag but the mixture of gasses in the atmosphere are free-flowing and exchange with some of the gasses in the room that the bag is opened into. Unless the ziploc bag is opened up in a room with very high humidity, this acton leads to a net loss of water in the closed system.  (create gifs in concepts.app)
- The addition of the sliced bread introduces free water back into the closed system, re-establishing a concentration gradient. The air gets humidified to a point where there is enough water that the sugar actually absorbs it from the air. 
- If sugar is so hygroscopic, why would it dry out in the first place?
- Water activity of bread versus water activity of brown sugar and vapor pressure of air at 70 deg F
Why does water make brown sugar soft?
Why does bread rehydrate the brown sugar? Why not use a tablespoon of water?

Double Solid/liquid vapor equilibrium. The bread releases water as it equilibrates with the air in the container.Then the moist air releases water to the brown sugar. But why does the brown sugar release water in the first place? Each successive opening of the container causes you to lose some water?


Earlier this week we noticed that our brown sugar had hardened making it difficult to use. We keep the brown sugar supply in a large Ziploc bag (yes, there are clearly better storage practices but that is not the point of this blog post). Fortunately, we know that dried out brown sugar can be rejuvenated by placing a slice of bread into the container. I thought it would be a cool experiment to weigh the slice of bread before adding it to the bag of brown sugar to see if I could measure how much water was being exchanged between the bread and our bag of dried out brown sugar.


**I set out to deterine: can a kitchen scale measure the mass loss due to water exchange between fresh bread and dried out brown sugar?** 

Because of the measurements collected during my experiment, I'm not able to answer more specific questions like: how quickly did the mass transfer happen, or how much water was left in the bread, how much water could the brown sugar have absorbed before becoming saturated. If I wanted more details I would have had to take more measurements. How much brown sugar did I start with, how dry was it really, how much bread did I start with, how much moisture was available to be transferred? What temperature did I run the experiment at?



After a couple days I checked on the bag of bread and brown sugar. The brown sugar was loose and crumbled when I touched it. That observation was different than the original condition of the brown sugar which felt hard. I

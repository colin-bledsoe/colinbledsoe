Earlier this week we noticed that our brown sugar had hardened making it difficult to use. We keep the brown sugar supply in a large Ziploc bag (yes, there are clearly better storage practices but that is not the point of this blog post). Fortunately, we know that dried out brown sugar can be rejuvenated by placing a slice of bread into the container. I thought it would be a cool experiment to weigh the slice of bread before adding it to the bag of brown sugar to see if I could measure how much water was being exchanged between the bread and our bag of dried out brown sugar.


**I set out to deterine: can a kitchen scale measure the mass loss due to water exchange between fresh bread and dried out brown sugar?** 

Because of the measurements collected during my experiment, I'm not able to answer more specific questions like: how quickly did the mass transfer happen, or how much water was left in the bread, how much water could the brown sugar have absorbed before becoming saturated. If I wanted more details I would have had to take more measurements. How much brown sugar did I start with, how dry was it really, how much bread did I start with, how much moisture was available to be transferred? What temperature did I run the experiment at?

After a couple days I checked on the bag of bread and brown sugar. The brown sugar was loose and crumbled when I touched it. That observation was different than the original condition of the brown sugar which felt hard. I

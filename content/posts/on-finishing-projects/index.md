For every project that I finish, there are probably 5-10 others sitting in states anywhere from 0-50% completion. 

I've realized something while writing up blog posts for a backlog of my projects. The majority of projects that have made it to some form of finished state have had fixed deadlines (i.e. Halloween, Harry Potter party). 

For me personally, this is good to be aware of. The lack of completed projects isn't caused by perfectionism or scope creep but rather by a lack of deadline or accountability. Without some external requirement, I struggle to have the discipline / motivation to finish what I've started.

Minimal recipe for completing more projects:
<ol>
<li> deadline (even better when paired with #2)
<li> accountability to another person
<li> clear scope (don't overcomplicate it)
</ol>
